# Single Cell Type RNA-sequencing Contamination Analysis
Contamination Analysis Pipeline

LCM-Seq datasets, as well as those of other data modalities that attempt to isolate cellular population(s) of interest, are oft subject to contamination by neighboring cell bodies/projections. The methods in this repository offer one way to correct for such contamination by estimating cell type purities and regressing out the effects of contamination.
